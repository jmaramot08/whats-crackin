A simple program that extracts data from the r/wallstreetbets subreddit using
the pushshift.io API and PSAW (Python Pushshift.io API Wrapper), and returns the
top 10 currently "trending" cashtags based on their mentions in submission
titles. Tkinter GUI created to run the program and display the output a little nicer.
